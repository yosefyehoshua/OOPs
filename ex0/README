Book.java -  This class represents a book, which has a title, author, year of publication and different
literary aspects.

Patron.java - This class represents a library patron that has a name and assigns values to different
literary aspects of books.

Library.java - This class represents a library, which hold a collection of books. Patrons can register at the
library to be able to check out books, if a copy of the requested book is available.

=============================
in this exercise I practice basic Java programming principles, including the use of Java primitive types,
flow control, loops and the creation of basic classes. I also practice writing Java code using a text
editor (inelliJ), and compiling and running Java programs using the command line. I implemented the classes
 by an API provided to me.

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
in ex0 we implemented a library system consists of libraries, patrons and books. Each of these components
is represented by a corresponding class. Libraries hold some number of books - limited by their individual
book capacity - and allow each patron to borrow books up to the allowed limit. Once a book is borrowed by
some patron, it cannot be borrowed by another patron until it is returned by its current holder. Besides
borrowing limit and book availability, borrowing is also affected by the preferences of the patrons: each
book has three characteristics that compose its literary value - its comic value, its dramatic value and
its educational value. Different patrons ascribe different levels of importance to these three 
characteristics; this is reflected by the individual set of weights each patron assigns them. The weighted
sum of the above characteristic reflects the total value a patron assigns to some book, and a patron will
only borrow a book that she will enjoy - i.e. a book to which she assigns a value beyond some threshold.
